# Say

[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/pdobb/say)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/pdobb/say)

Say gives you the API and the output style you already know and love from [ActiveRecord::Migration#say](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html#method-i-say)... anywhere! Plus a few extra goodies for long-running processes like incremental progress indicators and remaining time estimation.

## Installation

    $ bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_PRIOR_TO_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. Or, run `rake` to run the tests plus linters. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, bump latest ruby target versions, etc., with `rake bump`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
